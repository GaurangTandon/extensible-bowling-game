\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Short overview}

\paragraph{} Hey there, welcome to our Bowling Game project! We were hired specifically \textit{not} to build a new system, but to \textbf{fix} an original implementation by some other team in terms of its \textbf{extensibility and modularity}, and implement only a few new features into it. We have toiled hard to deliver a codebase which is as extremely maintainable and flexible, and no top of that, satisfies popular laws about software engineering code metrics.
\paragraph{} We have also included all three features, namely:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum multiplayer up to six players
    \item Being able to pause and play the game (and resume a paused game from memory)
    \item View statistical information about the best and worst players.
\end{itemize}
It was interesting to note that our refactoring was effective enough that implementing all these features required small changes to the code at obvious locations.

\subsection{Contributions}

Effort put in: 24 hours of work-time by each member. Role of each member:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Gaurang: Complete Refactor (Specially reducing cyclomatic complexity, implementing observer pattern)
    \item Animesh: UI based refactors (from the View Classes), miscellaneous fixes
    \item Avani: Building Documentation and fixing several miscellaneous code quality errors
\end{itemize}
