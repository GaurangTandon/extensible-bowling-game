\subsection{Short overview}

Hey there, welcome to our Bowling Game project! We were hired specifically \textit{not} to build a new system, but to \textbf{fix} an original implementation by some other team in terms of its \textbf{extensibility and modularity}, and implement only a few new features into it.

We have toiled hard to deliver a codebase which is as extremely maintainable and flexible, and no top of that, satisfies popular laws about software engineering code metrics.

We have also included all three features, namely: maximum multiplayer up to six players, being able to pause and play the game (and resume a paused game from memory) as well as view statistical information about the best and worst players. Notice that all these were simplified tasks and required minimal effort as a result of our brilliant refactoring of the codebase.
