\section{Issues with the Old Code}


\subsection{Minor Issues across all Files}

\subsubsection{Overly Broad access specifiers}

Most of the classes and the methods were marked public without a reason. Since most of the code is contained in a package and only the driver (and some interfaces like Party, Scorer, etc. to make a new game from same source) should ever need to be called externally. Therefore these access specifiers have been changed to \textbf{private where possible}, package-private otherwise, and protected in very few cases (where inheritance from Widget is required).

\subsubsection{Repetition of Code}

Apart from the glaring errors in code redundancy spanning all classes that were fixed by complete restructuing, some code exists which is used by multiple functions but not native to a class in the inteheritance tree. A few examples are writing to a file, or getting the date string. We have made a \textbf{Util class} for all of this, abstracted out the common logic there.

\subsubsection{Badly Written Loops and Conditionals}

Many loops
