This document outlines the major responsibilities of each class.

Some general terminology:

\begin{itemize}
    \item `XView.java` files are concerned with providing a GUI to the end user, and are mostly not concerned with implementing any logic. The logic is entirely contained in `X.java'. Both files communicate via an Observer pattern, where X is the Publisher and XView is the Observer.
    \item Other general things go here\dots
\end{itemize}

AddPartyView: GUI for adding a new party to the control desk. This supports being able to add or remove patrons from a party, or enlist a new patron and then add him.

Alley: represents an Alley, it's a stub class given it basically integrates ControlDesk and its View together, but given our requirements, this is fine.

BowlerFile: manages the backend of persistently storing patron nickk names, emails, and full names. Has public methods for adding a new patron, searching for existing patron, etc.

Bowler: stub class for a Bowler object, which contains a name, full name and its email.

BowlerScorer: companion to LaneScorer; manages the scoring for individual bowlers of one party on one lane.

BowlerScorerTest: a test file to make sure scores are correctly updated in BowlerScorer.

BowlerScoreView: GUI that renders a horizontal table of around 20 cells that update everytime that bowler makes a throw. It is unique for each bowler.
